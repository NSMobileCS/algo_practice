// A programming job I applied for asked "What's something that makes you unique? Be creative. (150 character limit)"
// After overthinking it, I figured cramming an answer to 'FizzBuzz' in there would be an interesting challenge,
// hopefully showcasing some programming ability &/or sense of irony that might work for me

let myMinifiedFizzBuzzThatMakesMeUnique=_=>{for(let i=1;i<100;i++)console.log(`${i%3==0?'fizz':(i%5==0?'':i)}${i%5==0?'buzz':''}`);}// by Nathan Smith
